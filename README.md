# Classic Models Sales Performance Tracking

## Project Overview:
The objective of this Business Intelligence (BI) project is to analyze the sales performance of the client's business in order to provide actionable insights for informed decision-making. The project involves data analytics on the client's MySQL database to extract meaningful information, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and visualize data using Power BI.

## Project Phases:

### 1. Data Profiling:
- Conducted an initial data profiling to understand the structure and content of the client's MySQL database.
- Identified relevant tables and fields necessary for the analysis based on business requirements.

### 2. Data Transformation:
- Utilized MySQL for data transformation, including cleaning, filtering, and joining tables to create a consolidated view containing the required fields for analysis.

### 3. Data Extraction:
- Connected Power BI to the MySQL database and extracted the prepared data view for further analysis.

### 4. KPI Definition:
- Defined key performance indicators (KPIs) based on business objectives and requirements.
- Identified KPIs such as Average Sales Value per Order, Net Profit, Sales Value MoM% (Month-over-Month Percentage Change), and Sales Value YTD (Year-to-Date).

### 5. DAX Measures:
- Developed DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures in Power BI to calculate the defined KPIs.
- Created measures for Average Sales Value per Order, Net Profit, Sales Value MoM%, and Sales Value YTD based on the prepared data.

### 6. Visualization:
- Designed visualizations to represent the KPIs and insights derived from the data.
- Utilized various types of visualizations including bar charts, scatter charts, donut charts, maps, and line charts to effectively communicate the sales performance metrics.
- Implemented filters for product selection and date filtering to enable interactive exploration of the data.

### 7. Dashboard Development:
- Developed a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI containing multiple pages to present different aspects of the sales performance analysis.
- Included visualizations such as bar charts showing Net Profit or Sales Amount by Product Line, scatter charts depicting Net Profit or Sales Amount by Cost of Sales, and donut charts illustrating Net Profit or Sales by Office.
- Implemented additional visualizations including maps showing Net Profit or Sales by Customer Country, line charts displaying Total Sales over time, Total Orders over time, and Average Sales Value per Order over time.
- Implemented filters for product selection and date filtering to enhance user interactivity.
- Created a separate page featuring a decomposition tree visualization of Net Profit by Customer Country, Product Line, and Customer Name, along with a table displaying Year-Month Sales Value, Sales Value MoM%, and Sales Value YTD.

## Recommendations:

1. **Average Sales Value per Order:**
   - Upsell and Cross-sell Opportunities: Encourage sales teams to identify opportunities to upsell or cross-sell additional products or services to increase the average order value.
   - Bundle Offers: Create bundled product offerings or promotions to incentivize customers to purchase more items per order.

2. **Net Profit:**
   - Cost Optimization: Analyze cost structures and identify areas where costs can be reduced without sacrificing product or service quality.
   - Price Optimization: Evaluate pricing strategies to maximize profitability while remaining competitive in the market.
   - Margin Analysis: Conduct a detailed analysis of profit margins for different products or services to prioritize high-margin offerings.

3. **Sales Value MoM% (Month-over-Month Percentage Change):**
   - Trend Analysis: Monitor sales trends over time to identify seasonal patterns or fluctuations in demand. Adjust inventory levels and marketing efforts accordingly.
   - Promotional Campaigns: Implement targeted promotional campaigns during periods of low growth to stimulate sales and drive revenue.

4. **Sales Value YTD (Year-to-Date):**
   - Annual Budget Planning: Use year-to-date sales data to inform annual budget planning and forecasting. Allocate resources and investments based on projected sales performance.
   - Performance Evaluation: Evaluate business performance against annual targets and benchmarks to identify areas of improvement and adjust strategies accordingly.

**General Recommendations:**
- Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on purchasing behavior, demographics, or other criteria to tailor marketing efforts and offerings to specific customer groups.
- Customer Retention: Implement strategies to enhance customer loyalty and retention, such as loyalty programs, personalized communication, and exceptional customer service.
- Market Expansion: Explore opportunities for market expansion by targeting new geographic regions or demographics with untapped potential.
- Data-Driven Decision-Making: Emphasize the importance of leveraging data-driven insights to inform strategic decision-making and optimize business operations.

By implementing these recommendations based on the KPIs created, the business owners can effectively leverage data analytics to drive growth, optimize performance, and capitalize on opportunities in their market segment.
